### Code Snippets

In order to showcase how closely intertwined the "User" and "Thought" models are, here is an example of the code behind the functionality of deleting a user from the database. As seen below, deleting a user would not only remove the user from the database, but all of the associated "thought" posts as well.

```java
  deleteUser(req, res) {
    Thought.deleteMany({ userId: req.params.id }).then(async () => {
      User.findOneAndDelete({ userId: req.params.id })
        .then(async (user) => {
          const userObj = {
            user,
          };
          if (!userObj) {
            res.status(404).json({ message: "No such user exists" });
            return;
          }
          return res.json(userObj);
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          console.log(err);
          return res.status(500).json(err);
        });
    });
  },
```
